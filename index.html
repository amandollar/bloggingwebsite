      <h2>Love</h2>
      <img src="./images/redrose.jpg" alt="red rose" class="blog-image">
      <p> Love, the most trending topic all around.Or you better say true love what people term it as .Very honestly for me it is one of those topic which makes me feel that ,quantum mechanics is easier.But at the same time i can speak on the topic for whole the day.
       <h3>24th of June </h3>
        
        Few people say it ,its the most beautiful feelings you will ever experience,some say it makes you feel butterfly in the stomach,or some say it like a magic.
        
        But the question arises is that why doesn't these feelings about someone last long,why it vanishes?
        
        Is the end of feelings towards someone is the end of the relationship?</p>
        
        <p>Okay lets start with answering the first one ,i do agree with all the peoples definiton about love,they want to convey the same things but in different ways,if we look into the physoclogical aspect of its nothing but you just had the happy chemicals for the moment and then you get attached.For someone it might be attractions of appearance ,for someone it might be attraction of thought process,for someone attractions charactersitic/behaviour of the persons.You just start liking any aspect of the person or many aspects of the person.
        
        The seocnd question's answer is do dam related to the first one. like okay fine you had feelings ,what next?One should rely untill the feelings exist?No,definitely not ,nothing in this world is constant,not even a single thing,change is the only constant,So one shouldn't rely on the feeling to keep a relatioship.Instead one should rely on respect towards each other,the trust towards each other,the understanding towards each other,these won't vansihes away quickly because these have build over time,these aren't just feelings but practises.

      <h2>Glow-Up</h2>
      <img src="./images/Glowup.jpg" alt="Glow up" class="blog-image" >
       <h3>25th of May </h3>
      <p>Glow up? I mean I was really thinking about it, when we look in our old pictures and compare it with the new one we feel like we have glow up a lot, we look better, yeah that's true but It's that the complete glow up? Isn't it obvious that our physical appearance changes over time and with evolution of AI the photos get better. But what remains almost static is our mental growth, which doesn't enhance without effort, it requires efforts and hard work. So the complete glow should be, glow up by physical appearance, (not necessary in all the cases) and glow and grow up brain, which is necessary. At the end of the day you get paid for what you have inside your head, and how differently you think about things!</p>

        <img src="./images/hustle.avif" alt="hustle" class="blog-image">
        <h3>25th of May </h3>
        <p>Hustle culture, this is also among the most hottest keyword around internet.Hustle for me like is working hard and harder for your dreams.But what the issue is nowdays the hustle culute has become toxic hustle culture.By toxic hustle culture i mean is people are promoted to leave everything and work,lock their self into the rooms ,this that and shit .What i want to point out of this post is its not bad to work hard on your dreams but it is really bad to fall in the toxic social media hustle culture.Do hustle for your dreams but don't forget to live in between ,don't forget to cherish your memories,don't leave your friends and family don't let go the relatiohips you have in the hustle period of your life.at the end jyou need close people to cherish your achievements. </p>

        <h2>Street dogs </h2>
        <img src="./images/streetdog.jpg" alt="street dog" class="blog-image">
         <h3>1st of May </h3>
        <p> Whenever I see street dogs around me, my mind always pops the thoughts of the way Mr Shantanu Naidu, yes that young guy whom you see with Mr Ratan Tata often.He created a belt for street dogs,that can be worn around their neck so that in night whenever lights fall on them,those belts reflect the light back.This initiative by him reduced the road accidents of street dogs in mass number.The lesson i want to point out from this post is that when you really want to help,the idea automatically pops out and like human beings the animals got soul in them too,so please its humble request that whenever you get a chance to help the street dogs around you don't hesitate.Even a biscuit could help them reduce their hunger.Thanks from the bottom of my heart❤️</p>
